Project Title
AuthOr — The AI Doctor’s Assistant for Insurance Approvals



Summary: Problem & Solution

Problem:
Doctors spend **over 20 hours a week** on administrative tasks like writing prior authorization requests, appeal letters, and dealing with denials. Each request can take up to **45 minutes** to complete, requiring perfect documentation that varies by insurer and procedure. This inefficiency leads to **physician burnout** and **delayed patient care**

Solution:  
AuthOr automates the prior-authorization process with AI. Doctors input basic patient details and clinical history — AuthOr instantly:
- Predicts approval probability based on historical data and payer rules  
- Flags missing documentation required for approval  
- Generates a fully compliant, insurer-ready prior-authorization letter or appeal in seconds  

By cutting administrative time from 45 minutes to 30 seconds, Author restores time for patient care and drastically reduces denial rates.

How AI is Used

AuthOr uses three integrated machine learning models:

Approval Predictor (LightGBM)
- Input: payer, plan, CPT/ICD-10 codes, treatment history (PT weeks, NSAID weeks, injections, etc.), and impairment data.  
- Output: approval probability and top contributing features.  
- Purpose: Gives doctors immediate insight into their likelihood of approval and what’s missing.

Policy Checklist Extractor (RAG + LLM)
- Input: insurer policy documents (PDFs, web pages).  
- Output: JSON checklist of required documentation (e.g., “≥6 weeks PT”, “objective neurological signs”).  
- Purpose: Auto-identifies payer-specific requirements for each procedure and cross-references the doctor’s inputs.

Letter Generator (LLM + Validator)
- Input: structured patient data + extracted checklist.  
- Output: optimized prior-authorization letter or appeal, validated against missing policy criteria.  
- Purpose: Generates insurance-ready, medically accurate documentation in professional clinical language.

Each submission improves model accuracy via continuous retraining on approval and denial outcomes.

Repository Overview
The repository includes all code and assets for a production-ready implementation of AuthOr:
- train_predictor.py` — trains the approval probability model  
- build_policy_index.py` — creates vector embeddings for payer policies  
- extract_policy_criteria.py` — extracts documentation checklists  
- generate_letter.py` — LLM-based generation and validation pipeline  
- app.py` — FastAPI backend integrating all models  
- /frontend` — Next.js interface for doctors  
- /models` — serialized model weights  
- /data` — synthetic and anonymized test cases

summary
AuthOr uses AI to eliminate repetitive healthcare bureaucracy. By combining real-world clinical data, policy retrieval, and natural-language generation, AuthOr allows physicians to spend less time fighting insurance and more time caring for patients.
